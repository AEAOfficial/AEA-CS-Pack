-fix typhoon
-Add transport
-Add SNIPER turret

-Increase mechgantry upgrade time: 60s - 80st3 

-Idea for black guard. Add a t1 unit called the “Lightning Bug”, a small $850 unit that can crawl on ground, dive under water, and fly. It has a short ranged Tesla attack that’s fairly weak, about the same as the normal interceptor from AEA. This will be a good counter to heavy interceptors, attack jets, and subs
Tesla does less damage to buildings so there won’t be much issue of it being spammed for back door shenanigans. Make it not attack air while crawling, has to be flying to attack air. When flying it can only attack air, not ground.

-Fix generator global resource

#----
Adjusted timings and prices of all the upgrades

Tier 3 black guard extractor now generates 1 Uranium 

heavy Lightning turret range 400 to 250  costing 15000 and 300 uranium 

Tactical mech 18000 to 7400 and 24.3s now repair speed reduced. Significantly. Can now build multiple. Different things. And tier 3 mech factory.

Strider faster 0.9 to 1.1 
Beam crab price 600-500 

Known bugs (the nano build feature on Leyte and tactical mech seems to be finicky. It only builds units at certain angles we will look for a workaround.
